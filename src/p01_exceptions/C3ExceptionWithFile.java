         * IMPORTANT NOTE (TYPES OF EXCEPTIONS):
         * *************************************
         * - Checked Exceptions => are verified by the compiler before the code is
         * executed
         * - Unchecked Exceptions => are NOT verified by the compiler.
         * Run-time exception and all its classes are considered to be
         * "Unchecked Exception"
         * 
         * Example#1: if you dig deep (CTRL+CLICK) the method .createNewFile()
         * you will see the Java native code:
         * 
         * public boolean createNewFile() throws IOException {...}
         * 
         * Since this method is built to throw an exception,
         * It means that "IOException" it's a type "Checked" exception
         * so we have to place the method that throws this exception
         * with try/catch or implement throws declaration
         * 
         * Example#2: if you dig deep (CTRL+CLICK) the method .nextInt()
         * you will see the Java native code:
         * public int nextInt() {
         * return nextInt(defaultRadix);
         * }
         * 
         * Since this method is NOT built to throw an exception,
         * so it's of type "Unchecked" exception
         * so we don't have to place it with try/catch or implement throws declaration
         * unless if we want to for handling any unexpected user'input
         * 
         * However, we can check all the possible exceptions for nextInt():
         * if we open the function and check the comments
         * 
         * @throws...
